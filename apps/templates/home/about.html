                  This space has been brewed and built with an understanding that each child is different and unique.
                  Learning disorders, as we know them does not limit the capability of your little ones.
                  It offers an opportunities to us to be able to perceive these young caterpillars with a newer
                  perspective.
                  This being said, it becomes very important as guardians and parents that we look observe the kids,
                  and look for any unusual symptoms and signs. But not being medical professionals can create a
                  wide gap between our comprehensive potential and a child's need.

                  We, at Neurodetect work together to bring out a way for parents and adults understand if their
                  loved ones have a possibility of one of these two most common disorders : <strong>Autism & Dyslexia.
                  </strong>
                  <br>
                  This solution brings together code and care together for a single cause. To get a brief about this
                  app:
                  We have two main services that we provide:

                <div style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;
                font-size: 23px;">
                  <strong>Dyslexia </strong>: Dyslexia is a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to
                  problems
                  identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words (decoding).
                  Also called a reading disability, dyslexia is a result of individual differences in areas
                  of the brain that process language.
                  <br>
                  Neurodetect's Dyslexia Detector basically provides a mechanism through which a child can go through a
                  small quiz including questions covering aspects like:

                <br>

                    <li>Speed</li>

                <div style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;
                font-size: 23px;">
                  On the basis of the answers recorded for each user, points are awarded to the user and
                  stored at backend, in form of testing data. These scores are analysed properly using
                  a machine learning algorithm.
                </div>
                <br>

                <div style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;
                font-size: 23px;">
                  Please note that this testor is a dynamic service, and you can test it in real time.
                  Graphs are also displayed to get a better understanding which models have been used and
                  why.

                <div style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;
                font-size: 23px;">
                  Error, Precision & Recall are some of the most significant metrics for determining
                  the model used.

                  <strong>Autism </strong>: Autism spectrum disorder is a condition related to brain development that
                  impacts
                  how a person perceives and socializes with others, causing problems in social
                  interaction and communication. The disorder also includes limited and repetitive patterns
                  of behavior. The term <i>"spectrum" </i>in autism spectrum disorder refers to the wide range of
                  symptoms and severity.

                <div style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;
                font-size: 23px;">
                  Neurodetect's Autism Detector basically makes use of neural network models to get a precise
                  result of whether or not a child has Autism.
                </div>
                <br>

                <div style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;
                font-size: 23px;">
                  Please note that this service is not dynamic as of now. The model on front-end will ideally be
                  consuming the user image as an input and an image detection model, utilizing openCV capabilities
                  of Python will be used here.
                </div>
                <br>

                <div style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;
                font-size: 23px;">
                  Once the facial features are detected and analysed, they are sent as a test/validation data
                  to the model and we get the result. But since here we are facing some error while integrating
                  these two modules, we have prefered to keep this functionality static.
                </div>
                <br>

                <div style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;
                font-size: 23px;">
                  However, this must be noted in all the cases that these diorders are just a biological/
                  bodily issues and has nothing to do with intelligence and brilliance of a child.
                  The youth of today are not only smart but also effecient and bright. Don't let these
                  little hurdles make them feel low of themselves. They need and deserve all your
                  support and encouragement.

                  P.S: Parents, guardians and professionals using Neurodetect are advised to seek
                  professional help before jumping to conclusions. Let's not forget that the
                  accuracy of this mechanism is determined by a modeled machine, which may not
                  always be on point and it's always advisable to consult doctors and professionals
                  for the final results.
