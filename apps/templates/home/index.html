                      Learning disability, learning disorder, or learning
                      difficulty (British English) is a condition in the brain
                      that causes difficulties comprehending or processing
                      information and can be caused by several different
                      factors.While learning disability and learning disorder
                      are often used interchangeably, they differ in many ways.
                      Disorder refers to significant learning problems in an
                      academic area. These problems, however, are not enough to
                      warrant an official diagnosis. Learning disability, on the
                      other hand, is an official clinical diagnosis, whereby the
                      individual meets certain criteria, as determined by a
                      professional (such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, speech
                      language pathologist, or pediatrician). The difference is
                      in degree, frequency, and intensity of reported symptoms
                      and problems, and thus the two should not be confused.

                      Dyslexia is a learning disorder that involves difficulty
                      reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and
                      learning how they relate to letters and words (decoding).
                      Also called a reading disability, dyslexia is a result of
                      individual differences in areas of the brain that process
                      language.Dyslexia is not due to problems with
                      intelligence, hearing or vision. Most children with
                      dyslexia can succeed in school with tutoring or a
                      specialized education program. Emotional support also
                      plays an important role.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Though there's no cure for dyslexia, early assessment and
                      intervention result in the best outcome. Sometimes
                      dyslexia goes undiagnosed for years and isn't recognized
                      until adulthood, but it's never too late to seek help.

                      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental
                      disability caused by differences in the brain. Some people
                      with ASD have a known difference, such as a genetic
                      condition. Other causes are not yet known. Scientists
                      believe there are multiple causes of ASD that act together
                      to change the most common ways people develop. We still
                      have much to learn about these causes and how they impact
                      people with ASD. The abilities and needs of autistic
                      people vary and can evolve over time. While some people
                      with autism can live independently, others have severe
                      disabilities and require life-long care and support.
                      Autism often has an impact on education and employment
                      opportunities. In addition, the demands on families
                      providing care and support can be significant. Societal
                      attitudes and the level of support provided by local and
                      national authorities are important factors determining the
                      quality of life of people with autism. Characteristics of
                      autism may be detected in early childhood, but autism is
                      often not diagnosed until much later.
